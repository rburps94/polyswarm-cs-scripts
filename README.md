# PolySwarm Scripts

This is a central location used to store single-use scripts created by Customer Success at PolySwarm, utilising PolySwarm's public API. 

The API in question can be found on our documentation website at: https://docs.polyswarm.io

## CURRENT FOLDER STRUCTURE

### /ai-model-outreach

This script will use the IOC Search functionality to output a list of hashes that reach out to the top known LLMs; further research should be carried out to understand if these are malicious. Note that these samples have been sandboxed, hence have been seen to communicate with live LLM URLs.

**Folder Contents:**
1. **search_ai_malware.py**: Download script locally, add your api key and run
2. **llm_domain_hash_search_results.json**: produced output from above script

### /polyswarm-to-threatconnect-ioc-pipeline

This folder contains two coordinated Python scripts. The first script collects recent malware hashes from PolySwarm, retrieves their associated IOCs, and saves them to a JSON file. The second script reads that JSON file and imports the IP and URL indicators into ThreatConnect with full tagging.

These scripts work together as a simple pipeline to move high quality PolySwarm intelligence into ThreatConnect for enrichment, detection, and investigation workflows.

**Folder Contents:**
1. **script1_polyswarm_ioc_collector.py:** 
Fetches recent malware samples from PolySwarm, extracts IPs, URLs and TTPs, and saves everything into a timestamped JSON file.
Delete any existing JSON in the folder, add your PolySwarm API key, and run.
2. **script2_threatconnect_importer.py:**
Reads the JSON file created by Script 1 and creates indicators in ThreatConnect (IP Addresses and URLs only).
Add your ThreatConnect API credentials and run.
3. **polyswarm_iocs_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json:**
The output file generated by Script 1, containing hashes plus all extracted IOCs and metadata.
